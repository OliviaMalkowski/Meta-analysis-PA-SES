Syntax and data files for "Correlates and determinants of physical activity among older adults of low versus high socio-economic status: A systematic review and meta-analysis"

The repository contains the syntax files for the meta-analyses and the extraction of additional data from publicly available datasets (as indicated by a † symbol in Additional file 5 of the systematic review); all data underlying the meta-analyses (censored where necessary to meet statistical disclosure control standards); results of sensitivity and subgroup analyses, funnel plots, and Egger’s regression tests; as well as a complete record of independent variables, higher-order exposures, and studies that were included in the systematic review but not meta-analysed.
